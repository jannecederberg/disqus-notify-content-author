# Disqus Author Notify for WordPress 

## In a nutshell

This [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) plugin notifies post/page author of comments posted through the
[Disqus Comment System](http://wordpress.org/plugins/disqus-comment-system/) plugin just like the regular WordPress
comment notification functionality.

Tested in March 2014 on WP 3.8.1 and WP's [Disqus plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/disqus-comment-system/) version 2.74.

## Background

In WordPress settings you can define for WP to email the post/page author whenever a comment is posted on their content.
However, if you're using the [Disqus Comment System](http://wordpress.org/plugins/disqus-comment-system/) plugin (at
least up to version 2.74), then you won't get these notifications. Instead, only comment moderators will be notified.

## Why not simply modify Disqus plugin code?

For example on wpdailybits.com in a post dated Nov. 2010 a solution is presented encouraging people to "hack" the Disqus plugin
code: [How to Make Disqus Notify the Post Author When a New Comment Is Posted?](http://wpdailybits.com/blog/notify-post-author-for-new-comment-disqus/45)

Sure, this approach works...BUT...

You SHOULD NOT modify the Disqus Comment System plugin code to accomplish author notification. Why? Because it'll break your
upgrade path! In other words, any time you update your Disqus plugin, you'll have to remember to re-apply your modification...

And what if you manage multiple WP sites? There's a 95.37% chance you'll forget to re-apply
the change on at least one of those WP instances at least sometime...plus it's pretty annoying re-applying the change over and over again.

## A more elegant solution

Utilize WP's <kbd>wp_insert_comment</kbd> hook/action and the <kbd>wp_notify_postauthor</kbd> function as done in this plugin.
See below for instructions.

## Usage

Git clone or simply copy the files into <kbd>wproot/wp-content/plugins/disqus-author-notify</kbd> and then go to the
Plugins page in WP and enable it.
