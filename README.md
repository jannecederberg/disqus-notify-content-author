# Disqus Notify Content Author

## What is this plugin for?

In case you're using Disqus Comment System on your WordPress blog, you've lost the comment notification feature that is normally present in WordPress: in other words, when someone comments on a post/page by author A, author A should get an email notification about the comment. When using Disqus however, only Disqus comment moderators get notified of comments to posts/pages.

This plugin fixes that problem by notifying authors of comments to their posts/pages regardless of whether or not they are comment moderators on Disqus.

## Using this WordPress plugin

To use this plugin, search in your WordPress plugins installation for *disqus notify* (or simply go to this url: `<your-wp-site>/wp-admin/plugin-install.php?tab=search&s=disqus+notify`) and simply install it.

Alternatively you can [head over to the WordPress.org page of this plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/disqus-notify-content-author/).
