# Wordpress Comment Notify

Notifies post/page author of comments posted. Works even if you're using Disqus Comment System for your WP site. Tested on WP 3.8.1.

## Usage

Clone into <kbd>wproot/wp-content/plugins</kbd> and then go to the Plugins page in WP and enable it.

## Disclaimer

This plugin was written strictly to scratch my own itch at [Opetus.tv](http://opetus.tv) and hence currently has all strings as hard-coded strings and in Finnish. Maybe I'll develop the plugin further to include a translation file (.po). Feel free to use/modify the plugin if you find it useful.

## License

This plugin is released under GPLv2 license just like [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/about/license).
