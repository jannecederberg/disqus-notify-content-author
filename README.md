# Disqus Notify Content Author (WP plugin)

## Plugin installation

If you're simply looking to install this plugin on your WordPress site,
you should not use the code here but instead navigate to the Add new Plugin
section of your WordPress admin panel and search for <kbd>disqus notify content author</kbd>
(direct url: <kbd><a onclick="javascript:var u=prompt('If you\'re logged in to your WP, this link will point you to the admin interface to install my plugin.\n\nWhat\'s your WP URL?','http://'); location.href=u+'/wp-admin/plugin-install.php?tab=search&s=disqus+notify+content+author';">&lt;wp-url&gt;wp-admin/plugin-install.php?tab=search&s=disqus+notify+content+author</a></kbd>).

## Purpose of the plugin

The purpose of the plugin is to notify post/page authors (on multi-author sites)
of comments posted on their content when using the
[Disqus Comment System](http://wordpress.org/plugins/disqus-comment-system) plugin.
By default the Disqus plugin prevents the default WP author notification feature
and this plugin fixes that.

## Repo duplication notice

This repository is a duplicate of my wordpress.org-hosted version of the
[Disqus Notify Content Author](http://wordpress.org/plugins/disqus-notify-content-author).
WordPress plugin.
